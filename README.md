### Hi, i'm Jacob üë®‚Äçüíª

I am a software engineer working at Lowe's Companies Inc.. 

I am an experienced web developer that has built and shipped applications that have reached 100k+ unique users and are still used each day after several years. I primarily work with front-end technologies such as React & GraphQL. You can view some of my personal projects [here](https://www.jlbroughton.com).

7.18 years ago I started learning how to code at a 'Full Stack Web Development' bootcamp at UNCC, and have been building things ever since. I am also a student at CPCC pursuing a degree in Computer Science.

### Hi, i'm Jacob. I'm a web developer at Lowe's Companies, Inc., and living in Charlotte, NC.

4 years ago I started this journey of learning the ways of the web with a 'Full Stack Web Development' bootcamp at UNCC.

At work, I create applications using React & Redux, PHP, SQL / SQL Server, and of course CSS.

While i'm not working, I love to mountain bike. Mainly jumping and riding downhill / enduro trails. Cars are cool too, right now I'm working on a 1995 Miata (first project, but an interesting one for sure).

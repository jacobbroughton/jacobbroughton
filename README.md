### Hi, I'm Jacob. I'm a web developer at Lowe's Companies, Inc., and I live in Charlotte, NC.

6~ years ago I started learning how to code at a 'Full Stack Web Development' boot camp at UNCC. It was an 'on-a-whim' decision to go to that boot camp since I, at the time, was actually thinking of becoming a welder. I saw an ad on Reddit for the boot camp and figured it might be a good idea. Prior to that, though, I was really into computers and technology in general, but my coding experience was next to non-existent other than a single class in middle school.

For personal projects, I like to build stuff with React, Redux, and Node.js / Express / MySQL backends.
